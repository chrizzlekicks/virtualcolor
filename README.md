# VIRTUAL COLOR

Welcome to the repository of the new AUROOM landing page. Check the current status here:
**[Virtual Color Landing Page](https://chrizzlekicks.github.io/virtualcolor/)**

## Project Description

In order to realize a product page at a larger scale, we had to plan ahead and come up with a general structure. We therefore decided to put our ideas together in a Miro board. The outcome can be found below.

After devising a rough IA and setting the goals for the website, we quickly started to work on the design protoype. We used Adobe XD to design some wireframes which became a full-fledged prototype within days. Shortly after presenting the prototype to our designers, we continued with the HTML files and applied some minor CSS styles. It became pretty clear that we did not want to rely on any framework like Bootstrap since we wanted to get the basics right. Also, applying standard CSS gave us the freedom to customize our website according to the style guide of BASF. Thus, one of our main goals was to make the website as repsonive and as appealing as possible! We flavored our product with some JavaScript to increase interactivity, and stored content within our script to load it dynamically (as a stepping stone for the prospective application of JS frameworks like React or Angular). In the end, our project got appraisal by our mentors for its professional design and appealing visuals, but also for the ability to load content dynamically via JS to improve performance. But we are far from done, as this is just the beginning!

## Technologies Applied

* HTML5: used for basic structure, some hard-coded content, images, etc.
* CSS3: styling of entire page, responsive web design, animations, etc.
* Vanilla JavaScript: interactivity, e.g. sticky navbar, navbar toggles, collapsibles, storing content within script and dynamice rendering
* NodeJS: JavaScript runtime engine used to write server-side JS code
* ExpressJS: minimalistic web framework for JavaScript to set up servers, APIs, etc.

## Next Steps and Functions to Add

Even though the learning journey is over now (in total 3 months of online courses and project work), we are far from done. Our next features and steps are more or less defined. Furthermore, we have the support and commitment from our supervisors to make the AUROOM landing page productive. The next steps look as follows:

* fill in more content and get rid of lorem ipsum placeholders
* add additional animations, slide shows, etc.
* provide a contact form for clients
* set up databases for content
* work with SCSS to improve readability of CSS code
* work with module bundlers, e.g. webpack
* etc.

Do you have any questions, feedback, remarks, etc.? Get in touch with us!

Cheers!
